Our model, a **Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)** was trained on feature-engineered

Gradient Boosting Classifiers are known to perform well even with small datasets, just like

- **Low ROI 游댮(<= 0.66)**: Campaigns fail to generate significant returns, potentially caused by factors such as poor targeting or weak conversion rates.
- **Medium ROI 游리(0.67 - 1.32)**: Campaigns are profitable but can be further optimised.
- **High ROI 游릭(>= 1.33)**: Campaign is performing extremely well, due to a combination of effective targeting, high conversion rates etc.

Apart from improving model performance, converting raw ROI values into distinct tiers
can also enable strategic decision making by translating complex metrics into more
comprehensible and actionable business insights.
