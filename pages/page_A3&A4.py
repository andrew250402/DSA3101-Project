The graph above highlights the **mean product usage** across customer segments, revealing
which popularity of products  within their respective segments. These enable
targeted advertising, as we are able to efficiently allocate resources to maximise returns
from every segment.

### Insights and Recommendations:
- **Cluster 0 (Conservative Savers)**: It appears that **investment products are underutilised**
in this segment. Marketing efforts for investment products can be scaled up to improve product
utlisation in this segment.
- **Cluster 1 (High-value Customers)**: Product usage is relatiely **high across all 
categories** as compared to the other clusters, except for Personal Loans. Promoting personal
Loan services with lower interest rates to customers in this segment can boost adoption.
- **Cluster 2 (Everyday Spenders)**: a **low usage of investment products** is evident. Promoting
investment products can drive up usage.

### Overall Strategy:
- Focus on personalized, targeted promotions for each cluster to increase product adoption
and maximize marketing ROI. Nevertheless, it is important to note that some products are
underutilised in segments as the customer segment simply **does not want** the product.
Extensive advertising may not improve returns. Hence, an alternative marketing approach
that can be considered is to promote the products which are of high usages to further
capitalise on the already proven product preferences.

The graph above depicts the **peak monthly spending** and **peak monthly transaction count**
across the different clusters. This visualisation gives us insights into the spending
habits of the different clusters to better cater promotions and incentives towards them.

### Insights and Recommendations:
- **Cluster 0**: Cluster 0 has the **lowest** peak monthly spending and transaction frequency.
Offering re-engagement campaigns such as cashbacks and discount can incentivise higher
spending frequency and in greater amounts.
- **Cluster 1**: Cluster 1 has the **highest** peak spending habits across the three segments.
Providing exclusive perks such as priority customer service can encourage their continued
engagement with the bank. Spending habits can be further incentivised through promotions such
as travel miles.
-**Cluster 2**: Has a moderate peak month spending frequency but **middling spend per transaction**.
Higher spending per transaction can be incentivised by offering discounts after achieving
certain spending thresholds.

### Overall Strategy:
Tailor promotions and incentives based on the spending habits of the segment to maximize engagement
and increase overall spending.

The visualisation above depicts the **average number of logins** per week for the
Mobile and Web banking platforms, across three customer segments. 

### Insights and Recommendations:
We observe a consistent trend across all the displayed clusters that the **mobile app
receives more interaction** than the web platform. More resources can be invested into the
mobile application to improve customer experience, through which personalised marketing
recommendations can also be pushed out.

### Overall Strategy:
Focus on optimizing the mobile experience to increase engagement and deliver targeted, personalized offers.

### Overview
To evaluate campaign performance, we developed metrics such as engagement score, conversion
rate, total profit and customer lifetime value (CLV) from each campaign. We then used
clustering and correlation matrix to identify patterns.

### Campaign Performance Evaluation  

To evaluate campaign performance, we identified and developed key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **engagement score, conversion rate, and customer lifetime value (CLV)**. We also calculated the **total profit** for each campaign.  

#### Key Metrics:  

- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of customers who converted after the campaign.  
- **Engagement Score**: Aggregated score based on user interaction with the campaign.  
  - Derived from **open rate, click rate, and average engagement time**, normalized to a value between 0 and 1.  
  - **Formula**:  
    ```
    Engagement Score = 0.3 * Open Rate + 0.5 * Click Rate + 0.2 * Scaled Engagement Time
    ```
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**:  
  - For customers who converted, CLV was calculated as:  
    ```
    CLV = Monthly Revenue * (1 / Churn Probability)
    ```
  - The **average CLV** was then determined for each campaign.  
- **Total Profit**:  
  - Calculated as:  
    ```
    Total Profit = Total Revenue - Total Campaign Cost
    ```

### Insights:  
- **Delivery Issues**:  
  - The **"Mortgage Campaign for Retired"** and **"Savings Account Campaign for Retired"** had particularly low delivery rates.  
  - Campaigns targeting retired individuals need further investigation to understand delivery issues.  
  - As a result, these campaigns also had low open rates.  

- **Overall Campaign Performance**:  
  - Open, click, and conversion rates were generally low, even for well-delivered campaigns.  
  - There is **room for improvement** in refining messaging and targeting tactics to enhance engagement and conversion.

### Insights:  
- **Engagement Score & Conversion/Profitability**:  
  - Engagement score is **negatively correlated** with conversion rate and has **almost zero correlation** with total profit.

  - Resources may be misallocated toward **vanity metrics** (e.g., opens, clicks) that do not drive conversions or profits.

### Key Strategic Recommendations:

1. **Refocus Marketing and Resource Allocation**

   - Allocate more resources toward **higher-profit campaigns**, such as **wealth management for the retired**.  

2. **Improve Campaign Effectiveness**

   - **Enhance marketing messaging and targeting strategies** to improve engagement and conversion rates.  
   - **Redefine engagement metrics** to align with actual business outcomes rather than vanity metrics.  

3. **Optimize Product Strategy**
