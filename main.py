**Method:**
- Applied **Hierarchical Clustering** to identify customer segments based on:
  - Transaction history  
  - Digital engagement  
  - Product usage  
- Chosen over traditional segmentation due to its adaptability to new customer data and reduced retraining needs.

**Insights:**
- Identified **three distinct customer segments**:
  - **Conservative Savers** â€“ Older, risk-averse, focused on retirement and low-risk savings.  
  - **High-Value Customers** â€“ High transaction volume, digitally engaged, responsive to premium services.  
  - **Everyday Spenders** â€“ Frequent card users who value mobile banking and cashback rewards.

**Action:**
- Deploy **segment-specific campaigns** to boost engagement:
  - Retirement-focused offers for **Conservative Savers**  
  - Exclusive investment opportunities for **High-Value Customers**  
  - Cashback and mobile-first promotions for **Everyday Spenders**

**Method:**
- Analyzed marketing channel performance across time and campaign types.
- Used **Gradient Boosting** to develop an ROI prediction model based on:
  - Historical conversion rates  
  - Campaign costs  
  - Engagement metrics  

**Insights:**
- **SMS campaigns** perform best on **Mondays**.  
- **Mobile app notifications** see the highest engagement on **Thursdays**.  
- **Mortgage and savings promotions** receive the strongest customer response.  
- High engagement doesn't always equal high profitability â€” e.g., some well-clicked campaigns delivered low ROI, while **Wealth Management for retirees** proved highly profitable.

**Action:**
- Reallocate marketing budgets based on predicted ROI rather than engagement alone.  
- Reduce spending on **underperforming high-engagement** campaigns.  
- Prioritize **high-ROI strategies**, such as targeting retirees for wealth management.  
- Optimize **channel and timing** to ensure each campaign drives measurable returns.

**Method**
- Developed a **predictive recommendation engine** using the **Apriori algorithm** to uncover hidden product affinities.  
- Combined with a **Random Forest model** to predict customer likelihood of product adoption.  
- Built a **Logistic Regression churn prediction model** using customer segmentation insights to identify at-risk behaviors.

**Insights**
- Customers with **credit cards** are more likely to adopt **personal loans** (product affinity).  
- High-Value Customers show churn signals via **declining transaction frequency**.  
- Everyday Spenders may churn if there's a **drop in mobile app logins**.  
- Segment-specific behavior patterns are critical in early churn detection.

**Action**
- Use predictive models to **proactively recommend relevant products** to customers.  
- Deploy **targeted retention incentives** based on early churn indicators.  
- Prevent customer loss by **addressing at-risk behavior before churn happens**, improving long-term loyalty and product adoption.

**Method**
- Created an artificial **personalization score** for each campaign to assess the level of targeting.  
- Used **ROI** as the primary metric to evaluate **cost-effectiveness** of personalization.  
- Analyzed the relationship between personalization score and ROI across different customer segments.

**Insights**
- **Young Professionals** show the **strongest correlation** between personalization and ROI.  
  - Highly personalized campaigns (e.g., wealth management or mortgages via email/mobile notifications) are most effective.  
- **Middle-Market** customers have the **weakest correlation**.  
  - General marketing strategies (e.g., SMS or direct mail promoting savings accounts or auto loans) are more cost-effective for this group.  
- Over-personalization can lead to inflated costs with minimal ROI benefit in low-response segments.

**Action**
- **Prioritize personalization** for high-response segments like **Young Professionals**.  
- **Reduce targeting costs** by using **general campaigns** for segments like the **Middle-Market**.  
- Use data-driven personalization strategies to **maximize ROI** while keeping marketing spend efficient.
